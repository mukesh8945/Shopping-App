Update product validation logic

This commit updates the product validation logic to handle edge cases more effectively. Previously, certain scenarios were not being properly validated, leading to potential issues during order processing. With this change, the validation logic has been improved to ensure consistency and reliability in our application.

This change addresses issue #456.
